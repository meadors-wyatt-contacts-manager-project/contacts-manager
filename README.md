# DocRob's Old Fashioned Console Game Dev Framework

### Description 
This project is a Java framework intended to help students practice their Java skills. The framework tries to hide some of the machinery needed for a multi-screen application, thereby allowing students to focus more on what each screen in their game is doing.

### Minimum skill level
The target audience for this framework is students who have finished a basic level of Java training (data types, variables, methods, arrays, conditionals, and loops) and are becoming familiar with how to express OO concepts in Java (classes, composition, polymorphism, etc.).

### JDK requirements
This project uses text blocks and enhanced switch statements, so please use at least JDK 14.

### To run via the command line:
You can run this application in an IDE console, but it looks better in a separate terminal. In the project's top-level directory, type `run_it.sh`. If you are using Windows, then use the Linux subsystem or Git-bash to run the shell script.

### Tutorial

The only documentation I have at this point is a little walkthrough, making a tiny game with a few rooms and an angry goblin.
